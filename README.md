The goal of the project was to perform data clustering based on available features.

Three algorithms were investigated. Each differs in its approach and choice of parameters. In the case of DBScan, a significant amount of data was considered noise and a full analysis was not possible. In my opinion, it is worth focusing on kMeans clustering and the elbow method.
